# Alteryx Splitwise Analysis Workflow

## Overview

This project is my very first hands-on experience with Alteryx! I created a detailed workflow to analyze spending data extracted from our Splitwise group, covering the period from August 2023 to June 12, 2025.

## Key Features

- **No-Code Data Analysis:** Leveraging Alteryx’s user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface.
- **Comprehensive Spend Breakdown:**  
  - Expenditure by each person and by category  
  - Spending trends by month  
  - Maximum spending periods and categories  
  - Utility and grocery/miscellaneous spending patterns  
  - Day-of-week averages  
  - Variance among contributors (cost distribution)

## Data Source

The dataset was exported from our Splitwise group and includes all expense records between August 2023 and June 2025.

## Getting Started

> **Note:** You’ll need Alteryx Designer installed to open and run this workflow.

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. **Open the `.yxwz` app in Alteryx Designer.**
3. **Update the input data path** if necessary to point to the exported Splitwise data.
4. **Run the workflow** to generate the analytics and summaries.

## What I Learned

- Alteryx is incredibly convenient for beginners due to its no-code approach.
- Documentation and community examples are very helpful.
- Visual workflows make it easy to understand and communicate analysis steps.
